### Greetings, everybody! üëã

 This is my first time using Git and GitHub, so I hope everything goes just right... I'll start by introducing myself.

My name is Henrique, but everybody here calls me Henry, as it's easier to pronounce. I was proudly born in Brasil, in the city of Florian√≥polis, and raised at a  farm on a small town. üáßüá∑

Here is a profile picture of me, for reference. ‚¨á

### My background

I am and have been a designer since I can remember. When I turned 10 years old, I discovered my love for animation and drawing, already playing with brands and soccer teams jerseys. With 18 years old, I left my parent's home when I was accepted at UFSC (a public university in Brasil), where I graduated at Graphic Design, specializing in Branding.

Here is a picture of me and my family when I graduated at Design. ‚¨á

### My hobbies

As a classic brazilian, I really love to talk with people, even in subjects I don't understand as much. I always tell my family that learning is my main passion.

I am an absolute screen fanatic, as I watch every Oscar nominated movie and every TV show that Netflix has to offer. My favourite movies are Forrest Gump, Fight Club and City of God. üé¨

Music also plays an important role in my life. Me and my brother have always played together (I sang and played the bass as he played the guitar). Honestly, I can't spend one day without my headphones. I'm an absolute Pink Floyd, blink-182 and The Rolling Stones fan. üéß

Some other hobbies of mine are designing, reading, drawing, gardening and watching mixed-martial art championships. ü•ä


### My adventure in Canada

A couple years ago, I married the most important person in the world. We accepted each other and the adventure of leaving our family, and everything we had behind, to come study in Canada. üá®üá¶

Here is a picture of me and my spouse at our wedding. ‚¨á

Fanshawe has been an amazing experience so far! I have met many different people, from so many different places. Also, I'm extremely excited to develop my skills during this program, meet new people and a totally different culture ‚Äî one of my dreams is to become a College Professor as well!

### Hello everyone!

### APPRECIATING EVREYBODY ‚ö°Ô∏è

It's my first time on github and also in the IDP3 Program, so I'm hoping to be enhancing my skills. My name is Ali El maniary, my friends call me Leo. Furthermore, I was born in France and lived there for 9 years, then I moved to Morroco and stayed for 10 years (because of my moroccan family). Here I am 1 year ago in Canada! So I'm 20 years old and have also lived in paris. FR (the romantic city) casablanca. MA (the economy city and the biggest).

Here we go to get familiar with me, there's a picture.

### MY BACKGROUND üî•

I have been a soccer player (a great player in the field), and because of my idole Cristiano Ronaldo I used to play with a famous moroccan club, and i played four different positions in offense (stricker/wingers/ amf) ‚Äî but here is the worst: I got a knee injury and I wasn't able to play for more than 8 months when my family ended my career as a soccer player. In an other way, I started in a kickboxing new career, I was happy with it! I'm a two years professional kick boxer with 12 win - 3 loses - 2 k.o, but because of my faces scratch my mom ended my career for the second time... so now here am I looking for a new thing and I think IDP3 is the best choice for me!

Here is a picture of my idole and the best player in the world and top scorer of the whole planet.
