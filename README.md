### Greetings, everybody! üëã

 This is my first time using Git and GitHub, so I hope everything goes just right... I'll start by introducing myself.

My name is Henrique, but everybody here calls me Henry, as it's easier to pronounce. I was proudly born in Brasil, in the city of Florian√≥polis, and raised at a  farm on a small town. üáßüá∑

Here is a profile picture of me, for reference. ‚¨á

### My background

I am and have been a designer since I can remember. When I turned 10 years old, I discovered my love for animation and drawing, already playing with brands and soccer teams jerseys. With 18 years old, I left my parent's home when I was accepted at UFSC (a public university in Brasil), where I graduated at Graphic Design, specializing in Branding.

Here is a picture of me and my family when I graduated at Design. ‚¨á

### My hobbies

As a classic brazilian, I really love to talk with people, even in subjects I don't understand as much. I always tell my family that learning is my main passion.

I am an absolute screen fanatic, as I watch every Oscar nominated movie and every TV show that Netflix has to offer. My favourite movies are Forrest Gump, Fight Club and City of God. üé¨

Music also plays an important role in my life. Me and my brother have always played together (I sang and played the bass as he played the guitar). Honestly, I can't spend one day without my headphones. I'm an absolute Pink Floyd, blink-182 and The Rolling Stones fan. üéß

Some other hobbies of mine are designing, reading, drawing, gardening and watching mixed-martial art championships. ü•ä


### My adventure in Canada

A couple years ago, I married the most important person in the world. We accepted each other and the adventure of leaving our family, and everything we had behind, to come study in Canada. üá®üá¶

Here is a picture of me and my spouse at our wedding. ‚¨á

Fanshawe has been an amazing experience so far! I have met many different people, from so many different places. Also, I'm extremely excited to develop my skills during this program, meet new people and a totally different culture ‚Äî one of my dreams is to become a College Professor as well!

To finish my presentation, I'd like to leave my portfolio website in here, so I can test markdown on links: [click here to access My Portfolio!](https://inkgamborgi.com/)
